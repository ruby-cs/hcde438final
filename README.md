# HCDE 438 Final Project
## Memorji: An Emoji Sequence Game

### About
Players must memorize and repeat a randomly generated sequence of emojis. Each round will become increasingly
difficult as a new emoji is added to the sequence. The player must recall the full pattern correctly
to continue.

### Goal
This game will provide an engaging and entertaining way to help users strengthen memory and
pattern recognition skills.

### Main Functions/Features
The web application will feature a starting screen, a page for gameplay, and a scoreboard page.
The user will press a “play” button to start the game. Emojis will appear on the screen, one by
one, to create a sequence the player must memorize. The sequence will disappear and the
buttons with the displayed emojis will appear on the screen for the player to press in the order
they remember. If the player loses, the game restarts. If they guess correctly, they continue to
the next level. A leaderboard will display the top 10 scores in the leaderboard tab
