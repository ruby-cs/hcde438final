# HCDE 438 Final Project
## Memorji: An Emoji Sequence Game

### About
Players must memorize and repeat a randomly generated sequence of emojis. Each round will become increasingly
difficult as a new emoji is added to the sequence. The player must recall the full pattern correctly
to continue.

### Goal
This game will provide an engaging and entertaining way to help users strengthen memory and
pattern recognition skills.

### Main Functions/Features
The web application will feature a starting screen, a page for gameplay, and a scoreboard page.
The player will enter a username (or play as a guest) and press the “Start” button to start the game. A randomly generated emoji will appear on the screen, which the player must memorize, and then repeat it using the 3x3 grid of buttons provided. If the player guesses the sequence correctly, they will move onto the next round, increasing in difficulty as one additional emoji gets added to the sequence. If the player incorrectly enters the sequence, the game will be over. Each new game will have a new set of emojis. The score is displayed above the sequence, along with the username the player entered. If they entered a name, their top 10 scores will be stored on the leaderboard page.
